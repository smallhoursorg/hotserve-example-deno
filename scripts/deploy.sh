# Deploys a release through hotserve's webhook and prints the result.
#
#   scripts/deploy.sh <artifact URL>     the box fetches it (CI: a release asset)
#   scripts/deploy.sh <app.tar.gz>       a local file: pushed in the request body
#   scripts/deploy.sh --rollback <ver>   relaunches a version still on the box's disk
#
#   HOTSERVE_URL          the app's webhook, e.g. https://deploy.example.com/example  (required)
#   VERSION               the release's version; defaults to the commit (12 hex
#                         chars). Versions are immutable on the box, so the
#                         default deploys once per commit: set VERSION for an
#                         uncommitted build (VERSION=wip-3, say). Not used by
#                         --rollback: that names its version itself
#   HOTSERVE_TOKEN        a deploy token. Not needed in GitHub Actions: with
#                         `permissions: id-token: write` one is minted per run.
#   HOTSERVE_AUDIENCE     the audience the box's deploy_trust expects (default: hotserve)
#   ARTIFACT_AUTH_HEADER  sent by the box as Authorization when it fetches the
#                         URL: "token <github token>" reads a release asset by
#                         its API URL, private repo or not (the workflow sends
#                         the job's own token)
#
# The deploy (or rollback: the same start, health gate and cutover,
# from a release already on disk) is streamed as it happens: one JSON
# line per phase, then the outcome — the app's status when the new
# version is live, or an error saying why it was refused (the old
# version keeps serving) — with the status code the request would
# have had in `http_status`. Every line is printed as it arrives, and
# a failure exits non-zero.
#
# In GitHub Actions the same output is also dressed for the job page:
# the request's output in a collapsible group, a failure as an error
# annotation naming the phase and the cause, and one line in the job
# summary. Nothing else is sent or printed; a run from a laptop sees
# none of it.
